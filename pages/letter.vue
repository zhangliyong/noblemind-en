      p.text-center.title.my-5(class="secondary--text") The critical decade, let us join hands together in the “Earthshot” campaign to repair the Earth”

      p 2020, the Earth seems to have started an era of extreme weather: Forest fires in the Southern Hemisphere lasted for as long as 5 months, hundreds of millions of lives vanished, fire had engulfed numerous major cities, making these cities veritable "human purgatories.
      p The Covid-19 pandemic swept the Northern Hemisphere, causing the world population to come under threat, the global economy, as a result, has been and will be hit hard. At this point of time, the situation of epidemic is still in escalation;
      p
      p Tens of millions of Americans were infected with Superflu, death rate exceeding tens of thousands of people.
      p
      p The unprecedented and worst locust plague in East Africa has left nowhere to be seen. Food supply was dire affecting many countries from Africa to Asia, and famine was inevitable….
      p
      p All these extreme weather events, large and small, makes it difficult for the entire human society to parry, looming into a state of panic-stricken helplessness.
      p
      p All these are nothing but reminders from Mother Earth to Mankind, ”I (the Earth) am your Mother, I nurture all beings, but I am very sick, I am in agony now!  My dear human children, if you do not wake up, and learn to respect nature and preserve me well, I will have to continue to adjust myself, through ways which we call “natural disasters” to evolve, to conserve the balance of ecological dynamics, and continue to survive.”
      p
      p 2500 years ago, Lao Tzu wrote a warning to the world in Chapter 39 of “Dao De Jing”,
      p “Against Dao/Nature,
      p (When man interferes with the Dao/Nature),
      p without that which makes it clear, the sky would crumble and fall,
      p without that which makes it tranquil, the earth would be full of calamities,
      p without that which provides nurturing and preserves equilibrium, creatures become extinct.“；
      p In harmony with Dao,
      p  ”The sky becomes clear, the earth becomes tranquil”.
      p
      p During the last one to two decades, humans have been led to religiously practise the Law of the Jungle i.e. “Survival of the fittest”. Humans relentlessly consumed, eroded and destroyed Mother Earth, they carried out cruel animal killings, excessive logging and land reclamation leading to calamities including rapid extinction of numerous species, severe environmental pollution, accelerating global warming, and continuous extreme weather events.
      p
      p In response to this, Prince William and Princess Kate from UK launch the "Earthshot Prize" World Campaign (2021-2030). Vision for the Decade of Earth Remediation: in promotion of a wave of ambitions and innovations, sparking a global movement to inspire a new generation of thinkers, movers and shakers, and visionary leaders; These challenges will seek transformative environmental solutions to the biggest issues currently facing the planet, including: climate and energy, nature and biodiversity, oceans, air pollution and fresh water.
      p
      p The Oriental Culture offers the world a time-tested solution leading back to the very origin and source of universe: “The way of Dao1 - men living in unity and unison with nature”. that is, men and nature are a community of shared life on Earth, the way forward for humans to protect themselves is to practise naturalism as a way of life, to respect and conserve nature, to lead lives in harmony with nature.
      p(class="font-italic font-weight-bold") Note 1
      p The way of Dao are the everlasting principles of nature bestowed on men and manifested through nature physical appearances and events. All beings will be inspired and guided by nature accordingly.
      p
      p Who are we? The Noble Mind Living Foundation (“Noble Mind”) is founded by a group of volunteers inspired and taught by nature, who aspire to uplift the quality of their body, mind and soul and breadth of vision. The non-profit organisation, after more than ten years of gestation, has emerged as a charity organization with license to seek public fundraising.
      p
      p Since its establishment in 2016, with Dao De Jing instituted as its core concept, many public welfare charity activities have been organised throughout the world, adhering to the organisation’s mission of "promoting the wisdom of nature and selflessly serving the public ". Our advocacy to the world: be inspired by Nature, uplift one’s emotional and spiritual quality, develop awareness that men and nature are a community of shared life on Earth.
      p
      p Commencing with protection of the spiritual environment, working from the very source in resolution of various ecological challenges faced by Mother Earth; for everyone to collaborate in development and erection: An Eco-village with great culture and substance, blissed and blessed artistically and spiritually, enabling everything to co-exist harmoniously. This is the Noah’s Ark for humans in the future; it is in harmony with the Universe, self-sustained, it contains and supports all livings in unity.
      p
      p We sincerely invite more people to come forward to collaborate with us, for our Mother Earth, for the benefits of mankind.
